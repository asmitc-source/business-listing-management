    q: "What does BLM software do?",
    a: `BLM gives multi-location teams one workspace for canonical NAP, publisher coverage, duplicate detection, and hours or category monitoring across ${COVERAGE}.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Who is BLM built for?",
    a: "BLM is built for multi-location brands, franchises, agencies, and local SEO teams that need a governed location record and a repeatable way to investigate listing drift.",
  },

  {
    q: "What is BLM?",
    a: `BLM (Business Listing Management) is software for multi-location brands, franchises, agencies, and local SEO teams. It unifies NAP, finds duplicates, scores directory coverage, and keeps ${COVERAGE} in lockstep.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Which platforms does BLM cover?",
    a: `${COVERAGE_LONG}. Coverage expands with Growth and Enterprise.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a credit card to try BLM?",
    a: "Start a free trial with a work email. We are not charging cards yet. Starter is listed at $49/month and Growth at $149/month when billing goes live.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is BLM different from editing Google Business Profile?",
    a: "GBP is one publisher. Listing drift happens when Apple, Bing, and directories keep a different NAP, hours, or duplicate pin. BLM treats the whole graph as one health score, not a single dashboard login.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is BLM a Yext alternative?",
    a: "BLM is built for teams who want listing health, duplicate control, and directory coverage without an enterprise-only sales process. Compare plans on the pricing page and the Yext alternative guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can agencies use one workspace for many clients?",
    a: "Yes. Enterprise includes multi-account structure so agencies can separate brands while sharing playbooks and reporting.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is NAP consistency?",
    a: "NAP is name, address, and phone. Consistency means every publisher stores the same canonical string, including suite lines, punctuation, DBA vs legal name, and tracking numbers that would otherwise fork a listing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does duplicate detection work?",
    a: "BLM fingerprints each location and surfaces near-matches on phone, place, and name. You review a suggested surviving listing instead of discovering the fork when reviews start splitting.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does BLM cost?",
    a: "Starter is listed at $49/month for one location. Growth is listed at $149/month for up to 25 locations. Enterprise is custom. Billing is not live yet. Start a free trial or book a call.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does BLM replace review management or rank tracking software?",
    a: "No. BLM is focused on listing data, publisher coverage, duplicates, hours, and categories. Teams that need review-response workflows, rank tracking, advertising, or location pages should keep purpose-built tools for those jobs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I start on Starter and upgrade?",
    a: "Yes. Start a free trial now. Stay on Starter at the listed $49/month rate or move to Growth at $149/month when billing goes live. Enterprise is for unlimited locations and agency structure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is listing data used to train public models?",
    a: "No. Workspace listing data is not used to train public models. A data processing agreement is available for Growth and Enterprise.",
