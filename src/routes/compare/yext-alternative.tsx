            BLM starts with a workspace and public pricing. Starter unlocks after you sign in. Growth is listed at
            $149/month for 25 locations when billing goes live. Enterprise is for unlimited locations, agency structure,
            and SSO. Yext publishes that pricing is custom by solution, location or provider count, and commitment term,
            with no single sticker price and no standard free trial.
